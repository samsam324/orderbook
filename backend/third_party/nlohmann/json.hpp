// NOTE for the current skeleton:
// The upstream nlohmann/json single header is intentionally NOT vendored here yet to keep
// the skeleton lightweight. When implementing real JSON payloads, do one of:
// - Replace this file with the official single header from https://github.com/nlohmann/json
// - Or switch CMake to FetchContent nlohmann_json and include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

// For now, backend code returns placeholder JSON strings without using this header. This NEEDS to be changed!!
