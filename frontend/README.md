# Frontend

Owner: ROLE 5 (UI + Backend WS API)

## Run

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The UI expects a backend websocket at `ws://localhost:8787/ws`.

## Status

Should just be the skeleton/placeholder for now. 
Later it will render snapshots, L3 depth expansion, and stats panels using the backend JSON schema.
